### NOTES

Spec == What you want == Desire == Can change
Annotations == How to get to your desired state == Rarely change
Label == Mark == Category == A combination != Not a placeholder of Values == Never change

### Immediate Actions
- Test Manually
- Update docs with sample yamls
- Changes to stor are not reflected - Reconcile is not working


- Add finalizer:
    - storageprovisioner.ddp.mayadata.io/storage-protection to PVC
    - storageprovisioner.ddp.mayadata.io/pvc-protection to VA

- Reconcile should return (bool, error) where bool indicates a re-queue


### Next Actions
- Errors should result into Events
- Errors should be pushed into status either 
1/ as conditions or
2/ set of errors or 
3/ an error 

- Main controller should have a registry of reconcilers; where each reconciler is
 responsible for a single reconciliation. There can be multiple reconcilers based on
 same apiVersion & kind.

- Replace Storage API with BDC API
- Need to think about how to include BDC API into this project

- Automated Test
- Make use of Metac
